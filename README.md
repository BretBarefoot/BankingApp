CS 210 Project 2 Savings account interest calculator

This app was to be able to give to students learning about finances and see how interest grows your money and being able to save money monthly will even create more savings.
The app would take input amounts for savings the interest amount of years and monthly deposits and generate 2 different charts showing how much money would be earned over that period of time between deposits/no deposits.
The most challenging part of this project was just remembering we where working with doubles and how to set up the formulas.  It wasnt too complicated but theres room for easy mistakes.
If I had more time I would go back and format the results to 2 decimal places.  It wouldnt take too long to do so maybe I will do that soon.
It was the first application where we where using classes with header files and definitions,  I think I could possibly adjust them some to make the main even cleaner.  The OOP used to create this is a very powerful tool to use on future
projects.

Thanks,
